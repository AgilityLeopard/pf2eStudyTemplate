          <h1>About this page</h1>

          <p>
            This page is an <strong>inofficial</strong> fan page for the Warhammer 40k Role Playing Game Wrath & Glory.
            The game is currently published by <a href="https://www.cubicle7games.com/?p=3870">Cubical 7</a>.
          </p>

          <p v-if="false">I was heavily motivated and inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/althalin/">reddit user althalin</a>
             and his <a href="http://apps.ajott.io/dh2chargen/">Dark Heresy 2 Character Generator</a>. You should
          definitely check it out!</p>

          <p v-if="false">Also, I quite often use the Official D&D Character Generator over at <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&D Beyond</a>
            and draw inspiration how to organise the layout.</p>
