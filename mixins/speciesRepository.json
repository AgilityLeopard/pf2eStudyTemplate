During their rise to power, this species uncovered secrets of the galaxy’s very essence, learning to create and shatter entire worlds. They discovered and developed the webway, enabling them to quickly travel across the galaxy without the risk of warp travel. Their collective knowledge eventually reached the point that any drive to learn dampened, as they could accomplish virtually any task they could imagine. The longlived Aeldari existed in luxury, pursuing whatever interests drew their attention. Eventually, such leisure led to increasingly hedonistic pursuits that spread in cults across their entire population. Those moral failings, over time, coalesced within the warp, giving birth to Slaanesh.",

Their incomprehensible physiology and ecosystem is capable of actively proliferating in even the most hostile of environments—from ash wastes, to overgrown Death Worlds, to barren asteroids. Even a small tribe of a few dozen Orks can inexplicably grow into a force of tens of thousands in relatively short order. The biological mechanisms behind this growth and adaptability confound even the most accomplished scholars of the Adeptus Mechanicus. There are no consistent requirements for Orks to thrive within any climate. However, their functionality is clearly evident on the countless worlds they have subsumed.",

The Emperor initially created twenty legions of Space Marines, each one containing vast numbers. All members of each of the twenty legions used a gene-seed developed from one of the twenty godlike Primarchs, whom the emperor also created. During the Great Crusade, Primarchs served as the generals of the Space Marine Legions, as the Emperor strove to reunify all lost human worlds, bringing the galaxy into Imperial Compliance.",

To aid the Tech-Priest, Guilliman provided him with an archive of genetic material taken from his fellow Primarchs, called the Sangprimus Portum.",
