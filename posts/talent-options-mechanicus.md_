# Talent Options: Adeptus Mechanicus

In this post, I want to take a look at some talents that are tied to the [Adeptus Mechanicus]() keyword: [Rite of Magnometrics](), [Rite of Fear]() and [Rite of Pure Thought](). I will evaluate the crunch (aka mechanics) and the flavour. I will also, check out roleplaying opportunities and what might be possible within a specific setting and if the Game Master allows it.

## Rite of Magnometrics

This is a nice talent and I will tell you why. First, with 20 BP, it's relatively cheap. Now lets explore the crunch:

* pick up objects
* Stick to metal surfaces or hover over them 

### Picking
It allows to pick up metal objects within quite some meters (3+Rank) with a Strength of 1+Rank. So a Rank 2 Character can pick objects within **3m** with **Strength 3**. Not so much but

### Sticking

This allows you to position yourself on unexpected surfaces, making it a cool gimmick for a sniper or assassin.
