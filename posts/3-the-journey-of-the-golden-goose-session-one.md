## New reader?

The story of Captain Vulpes continues. Check out [the kickoff session](/posts/2-the-journey-of-the-golden-goose-session-zero) write-up, in case you missed it.

## Recap

So, last session, Lord Vulpes escaped an ork ambush with the last remaining ship of House Vulpes, the Goolden Goose. Now he seeks to rebuild his fortune and the name of his Rouge Trader House. He was granted the opportunity to lead the exploration into the W22 System, a System, that had been cut off by a warpstorm that was now fading. Treasure and horror awaits (probably). But he is not alone. First, he has a trusted crew, and second he has some self proclaimed passengers (more are coming!).

Those are the **Tech-Prist Koreljow**, who wants to investigate and decipher a stellar phenomenon, the _Koreljow-Line_. Named by the man (in parts) himself, because he found this anomaly. What a machine!

Next, we have **Commissar Orlow**. Leading by example (and fear, well... mostly fear). He comes fresh from the academy and has the order to recruit as much man as needed, to support the Exploration Force. Assigned to him are two Bulklander, hughe landing vassels to bring the imperial forces to the enemy.

The **Astartes Epimetheus** from the Salamanders Chapter. Bound by an old pact to travel with Lord Vulpes. He has a friendly and welcoming attitude towards the mere humans. Unusual and refreshing.

So, this group gathers around the Planet _Cheribdion Alpha_ that will be the starting point for the Exploration, once all preperations are finished. But before we see what lays behind the warp infused rabbit hole, let's see what the missing three player charactes are doing, shall we?

## The missing parts

So, we will visit two locations. First _Aiden Hive_, the main Hive on the planet Charibdion Alpha. Here we will follow the journey of the local scum, **Cassidy Gaines** and how a ordered recruitment machine can suck an unwilling individuall into the training meatgrinder of Commissar Orlow.

After that, we check out how an aspiring Inquisitorial Akolyth and a Sister Hospitaller join forces.

### The scum psyker

**Cassidy Gaines** was (is? will ever be?) a lowborn scum, born into the bazzilions of a hive world. destined to live and die on this planet. Or so he thought. Destiny
