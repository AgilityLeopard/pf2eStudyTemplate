## New reader?

This a write-up from our Rouge Trader Style Wrath & Glory Campaign. I will talk about story, characters and (a little) about rulesCheck out [the kickoff session](/posts/2-the-journey-of-the-golden-goose-session-zero), in case you missed it.

## Recap

So, last session, **Lord Vulpes** escaped an ork ambush with the last remaining
ship of House Vulpes, the _Goolden Goose_.
Now he seeks to rebuild his fortune and the name of his Rouge Trader House. 
He was granted the opportunity to lead the exploration into the W22 System, a System, 
that had been cut off by a warpstorm that was now fading. 
Treasure and horror awaits (probably). But he is not alone. 
First, he has a trusted crew, and second he has some self proclaimed passengers (more are coming!).

One of those is the **Tech-Prist Koreljow**, 
who wants to investigate and decipher a stellar phenomenon, the _Koreljow-Line_. 
Named by the man (in parts) himself, because he found this anomaly. What a machine!

Next, we have **Commissar Orlow**. 
Leading by example (and fear, well... mostly fear). 
He comes fresh from the academy and has the order to recruit as much man as needed to support the Exploration Force. 
Assigned to him are two Bulklander, hughe landing vassels to bring the imperial forces to the enemy.

The **Astartes Epimetheus** from the Salamanders Chapter. 
Bound by an old pact to travel with Lord Vulpes. 
He has a friendly and welcoming attitude towards the mere humans. Unusual and refreshing.

So, this group travels from the _Hethgart_ System to the Planet _Cheribdion Alpha_ 
that will be the starting point for the Exploration, once all preparations are finished.
But before we see what lays behind the warp infused rabbit hole, 
let's see what the missing three player characters are doing, and how the join forces on
_Cheribdion Alpha_, shall we?

## The missing parts

So, we will visit two locations to wrap up the remaining PCs. 
First _Aiden Hive_, the main Hive on the planet _Cheribdion Alpha_.
 Here we will follow the journey of the local scum, **Cassidy Gaines** 
 and how a ordered recruitment machine can suck an unwilling  individuall 
 into the training meatgrinder of Commissar Orlow.

After that, we check out how an aspiring Inquisitorial Akolyth 
and a Sister Hospitaller join forces.

### The scum psyker

**Cassidy Gaines** was (is? will ever be?) a lowborn scum, born into the bazzilions of a hive world. 
Destined to live and die on this planet. Or so he thought.
During gang conflicts, an enemy leader leaked knowledge about Cassidy's latent Psychic Powers 
to the Authorities and so he was captured and contained so he can collected by the black ships.

But he was freed by a shady (very shady (very, very, VERY shady)) individual: **Vega Bolsota**. 
Cassidy received training by an accompanied and unsanctioned Psyker **Alfera**. 
They where later joined by an additional apprentice **Skoteinos Andras**.

So, to wrap this up. 
Shady training occurs, and one day, **Vega Bolsota** announces, 
that there is an Opportunity to leave the planet, but not on a _Black Ship_.

> “Interesting times are approaching.
> An, on a wave of such interesting times, interesting people are sailing
> Keep an open eye and ear and utilize what you have learned to gain the upper hand.” 

But before Cassidy can infiltrate the Rogue Trader (The Golden Goose, shocker) Vessel,
he is caught by the ruthless recruiting organisation, the Imperial Army.
And the recruitment is overseen by whom? Right, the stern Commissar Orlow himself.

So Cassidy becomes one of a million conscripts that board the Imperial Bulklander,
and waits for an opportunity to escape.

### Acolyte and Sister

Life under this particular Inquisitor from the Ordo Xenos was harsh.
The Inquisitor **Morosow** investigated and fights Xenos, while secretly obtaining respective 
Knowledge and Technology. In his cadre is the young, talented **Acolyte Josef Markovich** who
has a latent (hidden) Psychic Potential and follows his Inquisitor to learn and support.

One day, the Inquisitor announces, that they will travel to the _Gilead-System_, where a
warpstorm is about to fade. They will be accompanied by an Mother Superior **Seraphina Irinata**
and a small contingent of Sisters Of Battle. A long known connection between the to Leaders is hinted, 
but more, we only can assume (but better should not or **###REDACTED###**).

One of the Sisters is the (Tier 1) **Sister Hospitaller Syrene**.
A young, devoted and calm Sister, with an unharmed skin, long hair and beatifull eyes.
She is eager to save the lives of the unlucky but also occasionally assisted in 
interrogative torture, if it is deemed necessary. 

So, the unexpected allies travel on-board the Cruiser _Saint Celestine_ to the Planet _Cheribdion Alpha_.   
The Inquisitor contacts the Rogue Trader **Alexander Vulpes** and invites himself to join his exploration.

## Cheribdion Alpha

Lets wrap a little togather so that we can finally please make that jump. First, a short view on the
Hive World Cherib... Alpha. An Occean Planet, that produces the _World-Fish_, a lot! 
The planets output is responsible to support large parts of the System with food.
The planet was covered in polluted, blackish water with Hive Islands.
Overssen by the Gouveneur _Ganthet Veneratio_ from _Aidon-Hive_.

While Orlow harvests the Planet for Conscripts and Vulpes organizes the other essentials (mostly Amasec)
like colonists, food, material, the Tech-Priest does what he can do best, and occasionally
improves the output of several food production centers and also of underwater promethium refineries.

Anyways, once the Warp Storm declines, the Goose, the two Bulklander ()packed with fresh meat)
and the *Saint Celestine* do the jump.

## The Jump through the immaterial curtain

> Right through the eye of the storm. The red giant that gave life to the system
> illuminated all planets in the orange light of an approaching dusk.
> A scan from the Magos revealed that multiple space ships stood guard
> to defend the system.
> Only five planets existed, giants of gas and dwarven planets - 
> but the goal was _Cheribdion Beta_.
> The Planet counted nine hives in total, each representing it's one state.

### Whos the 'true' empire here?

So that was the setup. A message from the planet informed Vulpes, 
that **Chancellor Obedia** was the elected (did Commissar Orlow just fainted?)
Defender of the Planet, and he was not shy with some threats.

Vulpes proclaimed, that he is here to claim this system in the **name of the    
Emperor**! 
Two of the defending ships retreated and decided to stay neutral, but one remained.
The fight was short and the Goose, eventually vaporised the enemy with precise lance
fire.

Again, the Captain proclaimed his demands. Three of the Hives followed the call, but
the remaining 6 allied and **Obedia** announced them to be the "true" Empire (good lck with that).

Some planning occurred. Then the execution of those plans: The Astartes Scout Epimetheus 
and the Magos would infiltrate the main Hive and deactivate the remaining planetary
defence systems. Once they where disabled, the landing operation would start.

### Landing Operation

The fight within the hive was brutal, bloody, exhausting and deadly
(as Orlow will point out in one of his many reports). During th Raid, **Cassidy**
was split from his squad of guardsman, and started to wander around, having visions
of golden throne rooms and Eldar who flighted alongside a leader, clad in golden 
armour. (man, this guy **do** has issues...)

In the meantime, Captain Vulpes and his entourage and his allies lead the charge and breached the
central building, where the self named governor was expected. But right after the group with a few
imperial guardsman entered the central room, all occupants (including the furniture) where teleport away.

### Throne Room

The teleportion sickness was not the only problem. The group also found themselves at the receiving 
end of an ambush. The room was covered in golden colors and they where surrounded by enemy
troops. The chancellor and his first officer were clad in precious power armour.    

Seconds later, hell broke lose, when Las- and Bolter-fire erupted. The forfeitures gave at least a little cover.
And the Magos was able to manipulate the electronics, so that a platform in the center of the room, where the trapped
hold their ground, moved downwards. Som plasma and grenades eliminated some of the ambushers. And 
also the Chancellor officier was slain by a well placed plasma shot from Lord Vulpes Plasmagun.

The wandering and vision having **Cassidy* also found himself in the room, ambushing the ambushers,
he was (to his surprise) able to mind control one mob to eradicated one of their allies. He then
joins the group in the center platform, and Lord Vulpes, lusting for his (Cassidy's) potential,
enlisted the (obvious) Psyker on the spot.

But the battle was far from over, the Sister Superiour was killed by a Bolter salvo.
The accompanied Sister Hospitaller was overcome with grief and revenge and took the inferno pistol
from her slayed Sister.

Someone ordered the magos to lift the machanical platform back up. There, the Chancellor awaited them
wounded the Inquisitor and was about to finish him. While the Acolyte was about to sacrifice himself,
by jumping over to his Master, the Sister Hospitaller unleashed a burning shot from the inferno Pistol
killing the Enemy leader.

### Countdown

While the tides of battle changed in the protagonists favour. Lord Vulpes was notified, that the
Warp was about to close again. This was unexpected and would leave the exploration force trapped in
this system, not knowing when the warp will allow passage again.

Time was short, Syrene and Josef took the remains of the Sister Superior and the group started the
controlled retreat. While Vulpes calculated the odds of reaching one of the bulk landers in time
the magos anounced that the room they where in is not a building but a ship, merged into the 
hive probably decateded ago.

But this would only allow them to evacuate a small part of the Forces, so Vulpes made the bitter
choice and ordered The Lady Anastasia to conquer the Hive in his name. While the Group used some of
the escape vessels of the 'Ship' to escape to the Golden Goose. The log fragments from this ship
revealed, that this was the Captains Shuttle of the *Bringer of Wrath*, the lost flagship
of a Great Admiral of the Imperial (we will probably learn more about this in the feature).

### Back on the Goose

Back on his Ship. Phew.. the survivors prepared to make the Jump. But something was not settled yet.
The **Inquisitor Morosow** declared, that the obviously unsanctioned Psyker (scum) **Cassidy**
has to be executed. Lord Vulpes, seeing the value in the asset Cassidy, was arguing for his survival.

You see, the Inquisitor has nearly complete authority in the Imperium. But, this was Rogue Trader
territory. And the Rogue Traders *Warrant of Trade* granted the additional, nearly exclusive rights,
to expand the Empire in the Name of the God Emperor. The 'Debate' grow heated and almost escalated,
when Lord Vulpes turned to his Logbook memorator and announced:

> Please not in the Log, the Inquisitor did not Survive the journey.

Tension on the Bridge was... troubling, when the Astartes himself took the side of the Psyker,
mentioning how his appearance has saved the group in the Ambush. In the end, it looked like the
Inquisitor changed his mind. But his plans and ambitions stayed hidden. So the situation was
deescalated.

## Conclusion

So the Golden Goose is traveling back to Cheribdion Alpha, while the warp closes again behind them.
The characters will go their ways and we will see how they develop until they are gathered again
when the warp reopens some years from now. The Characters wil change, some more than the others.

For example the Sister Hospitaller will leave her Order behind and join the Order Militant.
In the end, all characters will now spend ther remaining points, and ascend (if needed) so that when
wee met again, all will have full grown **Tier 3** Characters.
   
We are two sessions in now. Various (now) NPC's have deep background and connections to the other
characters in the campaign. And when we meet again, the group already have a dynamic and a small net
of trust and conflict. An excellent mixture.
