## New reader?

This a write-up from our Rouge Trader Style Wrath & Glory Campaign. I will talk about story, characters and (a little) about rulesCheck out [the kickoff session](/posts/2-the-journey-of-the-golden-goose-session-zero), in case you missed it.

## Recap

So, last session, **Lord Vulpes** escaped an ork ambush with the last remaining
ship of House Vulpes, the _Goolden Goose_.
Now he seeks to rebuild his fortune and the name of his Rouge Trader House. 
He was granted the opportunity to lead the exploration into the W22 System, a System, 
that had been cut off by a warpstorm that was now fading. 
Treasure and horror awaits (probably). But he is not alone. 
First, he has a trusted crew, and second he has some self proclaimed passengers (more are coming!).

One of those is the **Tech-Prist Koreljow**, 
who wants to investigate and decipher a stellar phenomenon, the _Koreljow-Line_. 
Named by the man (in parts) himself, because he found this anomaly. What a machine!

Next, we have **Commissar Orlow**. 
Leading by example (and fear, well... mostly fear). 
He comes fresh from the academy and has the order to recruit as much man as needed to support the Exploration Force. 
Assigned to him are two Bulklander, hughe landing vassels to bring the imperial forces to the enemy.

The **Astartes Epimetheus** from the Salamanders Chapter. 
Bound by an old pact to travel with Lord Vulpes. 
He has a friendly and welcoming attitude towards the mere humans. Unusual and refreshing.

So, this group travels from the _Hethgart_ System to the Planet _Cheribdion Alpha_ 
that will be the starting point for the Exploration, once all preparations are finished.
But before we see what lays behind the warp infused rabbit hole, 
let's see what the missing three player characters are doing, and how the join forces on
_Cheribdion Alpha_, shall we?

## The missing parts

So, we will visit two locations to wrap up the remaining PCs. 
First _Aiden Hive_, the main Hive on the planet _Cheribdion Alpha_.
 Here we will follow the journey of the local scum, **Cassidy Gaines** 
 and how a ordered recruitment machine can suck an unwilling  individuall 
 into the training meatgrinder of Commissar Orlow.

After that, we check out how an aspiring Inquisitorial Akolyth 
and a Sister Hospitaller join forces.

### The scum psyker

**Cassidy Gaines** was (is? will ever be?) a lowborn scum, born into the bazzilions of a hive world. destined to live and die on this planet. Or so he thought. 

During gang conflicts, an enemy leader leaked knowledge about Cassidy's latent Psychic Powers to the Authorities and so he was captured and contained so he can collected by the black ships.

But he was freed by a shady (very shady (very, very, VERY shady)) individual: **Vega Bolsota**. Cassidy received training by an accompanied and unsanctioned Psyker **Alfera**. They where later joined by an additional apprentice **Skoteinos Andras**.

So, to wrap this up. 
Shady training occurs, and one day, **Vega Bolsota** announces, 
that there is an Opportunity to leave the planet, but not on a _Black Ship_.

> “Interesting times are approaching.
> An, on a wave of such interesting times, interesting people are sailing
> Keep an open eye and ear and utilize what you have learned to gain the upper hand.” 

But before Cassidy can infiltrate the Rogue Trader (The Golden Goose, shocker) Vessel,
he is caught by the ruthless recruiting organisation, the Imperial Army.
And the recruitment is overseen by whom? Right, the stern Commissar Orlow himself.

So Cassidy becomes one of a million conscripts that board the Imperial Bulklander,
and waits for an opportunity to escape.

### Acolyte and Sister

Life under this particular Inquisitor from the Ordo Xenos was harsh.
The Inquisitor **Morosow** investigated and fights Xenos, while secretly obtaining respective 
Knowledge and Technology. In his cadre is the young, talented **Acolyte Josef Markovich** who
has a latent (hidden) Psychic Potential and follows his Inquisitor to learn and support.

One day, the Inquisitor announces, that they will travel to the _Gilead-System_, where a
warpstorm is about to fade. They will be accompanied by an Mother Superior **Seraphina Irinata**
and a small contingent of Sisters Of Battle. A long known connection between the to Leaders is hinted, 
but more, we only can assume (but better should not or **###REDACTED###**).

One of the Sisters is the (Tier 1) **Sister Hospitaller Syrene**.
A young, devoted and calm Sister, with an unharmed skin, long hair and beatifull eyes.
She is eager to save the lives of the unlucky but also occasionally assisted in 
interrogative torture, if it is deemed necessary. 

So, the unexpected allies travel on-board the Cruiser _Saint Celestine_ to the Planet _Cheribdion Alpha_.   
The Inquisitor contacts the Rogue Trader **Alexander Vulpes** and invites himself to join his exploration.

## Cheribdion Alpha

Lets wrap a little togather so that we can finally please make that jump. First, a short view on the
Hive World Cherib.. Alpha. An Occean Planet, that produces the _World-Fish_, a lot! 
The planets output is responsible to support large parts of the System with food.
The planet was covered in polluted, blackish water with Hive Islands.
Overssen by the Gouveneur _Ganthet Veneratio_ from _Aidon-Hive_.

While Orlow harvests the Planet for Conscripts and Vulpes organizes the other essentials (mostly Amasec)
like colonists, food, material, the Tech-Priest does what he can do best, and occasionally
improves the output of several food production centers and also of underwater promethium refineries.

Anyways, once the Warp Storm declines, the Goose, the two Bulklander ()packed with fresh meat)
and the *Saint Celestine* do the jump.

## The Jump to System 'W22'

> Right through the eye of the storm. The red giant that gave life to the system
> illuminated all planets in the orange light of an approaching dusk.
> A scan from the Magos revealed that multiple space ships stood guard
> to defend the system.
> Only five planets existed, giants of gas and dwarven planets - 
> but the goal was _Cheribdion Beta_.
> The Planet counted nine hives in total, each representing it's one state.

### Whos the 'true' empire here?

So that was the setup. A message from the planet informed Vulpes, 
that **Canceller Obedia** was the elected (did Commissar Orlow just fainted?)
Defender of the Planet, and he was not shy with some threats.

Vulpes proclaimed, that he is here to claim this system in the **name of the    
Emperor**! 
Two of the defending ships retreated and decided to stay neutral, but one remained.
The fight was short and the Goose, eventually vaporised the enemy with precise lance
fire.

Again, the Captain proclaimed his demands. Three of the Hives followed the call, but
the remaining 6 allied and **Obedia** announced them to be the "true" Empire (good lck with that).

Some planning occurred. Then the execution of those plans: The Scout Epimetheus 
and the Magos would infiltrate the main Hive and deactivate the remaining planetary
defence systems. Once they where disabled, the landing operation would start.

### Landing Operation

The fight within the hive was brutal, bloody, exhausting and deadly
(as Orlow will point out in one of his many reports). During th Raid, **Cassidy**
was split from his squad of guardsman, and started to wander around, having visions
of golden throne rooms and Eldar who flighted all a leader clad in golden 
armour. (man, this did has issues...)
